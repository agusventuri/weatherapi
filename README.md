# weatherapi
This small piece of code is my solution to the code challenge provided by Globant while applying for a Python developer position.

Here you can find an api that takes two parameters as input for its only endpoint and produces, if able, a weather forecast formatted in a friendly way, using openweather as it's source of information.

Open your terminal and run the next command:
